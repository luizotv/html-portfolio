<h1>The Best Movies According to Luiz</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<p>Not really a  big movie/series/anime fan but here are a few remarkable ones.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Wild Eight</h3>
<p>A movie that is 3 hours long with 8 cowboys on a saloon in the middle of a snowstorm. Won't spoil it.</p>
<h3>Interestellar</h3>
<p>Beautiful and mind-bending movie. Also 3 hours long, I'm starting to see a pattern here.</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>The prettiest anime ever made (besides Jujutsu Kaisen), such an amazing movie!</p>
